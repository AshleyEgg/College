% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parantheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1 and store it in (GT).
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 

% Given Input Variables:
%   1. arr1 - An array of numbers 
%   2. arr2 - An array of numbers

% 1. Creating a "mask". In Matlab, one can perform a logical operation on a
%    full array, and get an array of logical data. This is also called a
%    "mask", and the act of using a mask to manipulate an array is called 
%    "masking". Create a mask of where arr1 is equal to 0. (A)
A = arr1==0;

% 2. Indexing with a mask. Data is manipulated with masks by using Logical
%    Indexing (or masking), which is where one uses a mask to index an array 
%    of the same size (and usually the array that was used to create the mask 
%    in the first place). Use the mask you created in part A to assign a 1 
%    into all the indices of arr1 that are 0. Assign the new arr1 to 
%    output B. (B)
arr1(A)=1;
B = arr1;

% 3. The mod() function may also be used with arrays. Use mod() to create a
%    mask (or logical array) of where arr1 contains an even number. (C)
C = mod(arr1,2)==0;

% 4. Replacing values with a mask. Masks may be used on any array that is
%    the same size as the mask, and (if using the mask to index on both sides
%    of the equal sign) values from one array can be assigned into the
%    corresponding indices of another array. Using your mask, C, assign the
%    even values in arr1 into the corresponding indices of arr2. Then assign
%    the modified arr2 to output D. (D)
arr2(C)=arr1(C);
D = arr2;

% 5. & and |. The "and" and "or" operators may also be used with masks and
%    will simply perform an element-by-element "and" or "or" operation. Use
%    this to find a mask of where both A and C are true. (Note: && and ||
%    will NOT work with masks. Those are for single true/false values.) (E)
E = A&C;

% 6. ~. The "not" or "tilde" may be used before a logical array to return
%    another logical array of the same size, but logical true values
%    replaced with falses and logical false values replaces with trues. Use
%    this to find a mask where A is false. (F)
F = ~A;

% 7. Use the knowledge obtained from parts 5 and 6 to find a mask where
%    both A and C are false. (G)
G = ~A&~C;
