% Directions:
% Write the code to satisfy the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parentheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 
%
% Given Input Variables:
% Part I & II:
%   1. file1 - A file name (including the extension .txt) of a given text 
%              file (char)
%   2. file2 - A file name (including the extension .txt) of a text file 
%              that should be written (char)
% Part III:
%   1. file3 - A file name (including the extension .txt) of a give text 
%              file (char)

% 1. fopen(). Open file1 for read access and store the file handle in (fh1)

% 3. fgetl(). Read in the second line of file1 using fgetl(). (B)

% 8. What is the data type of a file handle, fh, after the following code
%    is run? Assume file exists in the current directory. Express your

% 9. If the end of the current file has been reached after calling

% Directions:
% Open and read through the file "ABCs_lowLevelFileIOPractice.pdf". The 
% file contains an example drill problem, which we are going to solve 
% together. Follow the directions and write your code to satisfy the 
% instructions.

% function [J] = secretMessage(file3)
% 1. Start by opening file3 and storing the file handle in (fh).
fh=fopen(file3);

% 2. Get the first two lines of the file using fgetl() and store them in 
%    (line1 and line2)
line1=fgetl(fh);
line2=fgetl(fh);

% 3. Write an if statement for when the first line of the file is
%    'CS1371'. If this condition is met, set the output (J) to 
%    'Can''t chat, learning MATLAB!'. (Do not end your if statement yet).
    
if strcmp(line1,'CS1371')
    J = 'Can''t chat, learning MATLAB!';
% 4. Write an else condition for when the first line is anything else.
%    Inside this else statement, obtain the third line of the file and
%    store it in (line). Also, initialize (J) by setting it equal to [].
else
    line=fgetl(fh);
    J = [];
% 5. Then, write a while loop for when "line" is of type char. 
%    Inside the while loop, concatenate the first letter of "line" 
%    to the growing string stored in (J) and then get the next "line" of 
%    the file.
%    Remember to end your while loop and if statement.
    while ischar(line)
        J=[J,line(1)];
        line=fgetl(fh);
    end
end
% 6. Close file3.
fclose(fh);
