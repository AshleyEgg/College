FROGGER
Author:Ashley Eggart

I decided to make the classic game Frogger, with four logs moving at various speeds and 5 lily pads that the frog needs to reach in order to win.

Goal: To get all 5 frogs home to each of the five lily pads.

Controls:
Press A (Z key) to start the game.
To move the frog around the screen use the arrow keys.
If at any time you want to return to the home screen press the Select button (backspace key).

Rules:
You have 3 lives to get all five frogs home.
If you do not land on a log or a lily pad you will lose a life.
Once a lily pad is filled it will display an image of a brown frog and only one frog can go on each lily pad.
To win fill all 5 lilypads.
You gain 100 points for each frog that reaches a lily pad.
You lose 50 points for each life that you lose.
